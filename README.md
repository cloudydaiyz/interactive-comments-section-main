### What I learned

This project took a lot longer for me than I initially expected, but it was good for learning. I decided to use TypeScript for the JS code and tried to implement a MVC architecture based on what I learned before from my previous Tic-Tac-Toe project. While making the new elements and render() function from scratch based on the data that I had was insightful, if I were to do this project again, I would definitely use React. However, I don't regret the experience doing this in pure HTML/CSS/Typescript.

Some takeaways for me:
- Only create event bindings for events that will change the state
- Rerender only when the state changes
- You donâ€™t have to define all types in types.ts, just your main ones (at least for me)

### Continued development

If I were to continue this project, I would:
- refactor the MVC architecture
- use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
- dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted
- use React.js

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Web Development: In Depth (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsnQ5uepIaE) - Video by freeCodeCamp that helped me get my first steps into Frontend web development and introduced me to the frontend MVC architecture.
